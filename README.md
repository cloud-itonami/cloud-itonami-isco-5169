# cloud-itonami-isco-5169

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 5169**: Personal Services Workers Not Elsewhere Classified.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent personal services provider: a service-support robot performs supply setup and equipment sanitation under a governor-gated actor, so the practice keeps its own service and consent records instead of renting a closed personal-services SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a service-support robot performs supply setup, equipment sanitation and cleanup tasks under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Personal Services Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
direct physical contact services, or handling client health disclosures) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
client consent + service scope + appointment schedule
        |
        v
Personal Services Advisor -> Personal Services Governor -> service/log, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.
